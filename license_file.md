ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS

1. SECURITY ASSESSMENT TOOL
   This software is a security assessment tool that relies on user-provided
   configuration inputs. It does not perform active network scanning,
   penetration testing, or automated vulnerability detection. Results should
   be validated by qualified security professionals.

2. NO GUARANTEE OF COMPLIANCE
   While this tool assists with compliance assessment against various
   regulatory frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, etc.), it does
   not guarantee regulatory compliance. Organizations should consult with
   compliance officers and legal counsel regarding regulatory requirements.

3. MICROSOFT INTEGRATION
   Version 3.0's Microsoft Defender for IoT integration features require
   appropriate Microsoft licensing and are subject to Microsoft's terms of
   service. This tool is an independent project and is not officially
   affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Microsoft Corporation.

4. OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY (OT) ENVIRONMENTS
   Extra caution should be exercised when using this tool in operational
   technology (OT) environments, including industrial control systems,
   SCADA systems, and critical infrastructure. Ensure all assessments
   comply with your organization's change management procedures and safety
   protocols.

5. PROFESSIONAL REVIEW REQUIRED
   Audit results should be reviewed by qualified cybersecurity professionals
   before making deployment decisions. This tool provides guidance but does
   not replace professional security assessments.

6. NO WARRANTY FOR PRODUCTION USE
   This software is provided for assessment and educational purposes.
   Users deploying IoT/OT devices in production environments must conduct
   comprehensive security testing including penetration testing,
   vulnerability scanning, and code review.

7. THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATIONS
   References to third-party products, services, or frameworks (Virima,
   ServiceNow, Device42, NIST, ISO, IEC, etc.) are for informational
   purposes only and do not constitute endorsement. Users are responsible
   for compliance with third-party terms of service.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
   In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any
   direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential
   damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute
   goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business
   interruption) arising in any way out of the use of this software,
   even if advised of the possibility of such damage.

9. DATA PRIVACY
   This tool processes security configuration data locally and does not
   transmit data externally. However, users are responsible for ensuring
   that exported audit reports containing potentially sensitive security
   information are handled according to their organization's data
   protection policies.

10. EXPORT CONTROL
    Users are responsible for compliance with applicable export control
    laws and regulations when using or distributing this software.
